                Happy Birthday, my love! 🥺💌<br><br>

                From the very first UNO game request to late-night laughs, oats-filled love confessions, and being my baby every single day — you’ve made my world so much brighter. Even though distance separates us for now, my heart is always cuddled up next to yours. 🧸💘<br><br>

                You're more than just my boyfriend — you're my best friend, my soulmate, my favorite person in the entire universe. Thank you for loving me the way you do, for calling me your Sushi, and for being the sweetest part of my every day.<br><br>

                I hope this birthday brings you smiles that never fade, strength for every dream you chase, and all the love your big heart deserves. One day soon, I’ll be there to give you the biggest hug and say this in person. Until then... I love you more than words, more than distance, more than ever. 💗<br><br>

                Happy Birthday, my sugarboo! 🎉🐻<br>
                Forever yours,<br>
                Sushi 💕💖
